1. Open chrome browser and go to remix.ethereum.org and create a new file.
2. Copy the code and paste it on the said new file (make sure that the version
	in the Compile is the same as the written in the first line of the code).
3. Click Start to compile or just press Ctrl + S and go to the Run button, click 
	deploy and there'll be popping data at the bottom in transaction recorded.
4. You can insert new people in signMe by adding quotation marks(NOTE: click the
	downward arrow to expand the capacity the same as to the logMe) (example: "Name")
	then give the gender and copy the address on the account(click right next
	to the icon besides the account if you're the first to sign).
5. Then you can check if the data was stored in the getLength. Proceed to logMe
	and write the name with the quotation mark and the index should start with
	0 for the first account then click the transact
6. getElementAtIndex will give you the hash address of what you have entered that 
	depends to the according number when you entered it.
(NOTE: the first item you will be posting will start at 0 so you'll be typing 
	"0" in contracts if ever you need to see that first item.)
